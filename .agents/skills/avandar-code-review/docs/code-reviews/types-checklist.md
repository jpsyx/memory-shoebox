# Types Checklist

Use this checklist only when the diff includes TypeScript or TSX files.
It covers the type system itself: type declarations, assertions and
escape hatches, absence, literal unions, and readonly/variance
contracts. Naming, module structure, comments, and function shape live in
`typescript-checklist.md`.

- Never use `any`.

  **Find candidates:**

  ```bash
  grep -rEn '(: |<|\()any\b|\bas any\b|\bArray<any>|\bRecord<[^,]+, *any>' \
    --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
  ```

- Never write `as unknown as T`. The double cast silences every
  assignability check between the source and the target type, so a real
  mismatch (a renamed field, a widened union, a changed generic argument)
  compiles cleanly and fails at runtime instead. Most occurrences are
  unnecessary: the value already satisfies the target type and the cast was
  added defensively. Delete it, and if a type error appears, fix the
  underlying type rather than restoring the cast.

  When a type error does appear, the real problem is usually upstream: a
  parameter or field typed `unknown` that should carry a real type. Fixing it
  there removes the cast at every call site instead of one.

  Exceptions: 1) TypeScript genuinely cannot resolve the relationship safely,
  which in practice means a generic boundary where a runtime value cannot be
  proven to match a computed type (a dotted path string checked against
  `Paths<T>`, for example); 2) an existing cast that a comment already
  justifies on those grounds. A cast that merely saves the author from typing
  a field properly is not an exception. Structure the code to avoid the cast
  first; it is the fallback for code that is already well-structured. When one
  is unavoidable, prefer the narrowest cast that compiles (`as T` over
  `as unknown as T`) and comment which type cannot be proven and why.

  **Find candidates:**

  ```bash
  grep -rEn '\bas unknown as\b' --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
  ```

  Verify a hit by deleting the cast and re-running `tsc`: report a finding
  when the file still type-checks without it.

  This is bad (the erased view is already assignable, so the double cast
  only hides future drift):

  ```ts
  const DESCRIPTORS = {
    fields: [{ key: "name", control: "text" }],
  } as const satisfies FieldDescriptors<UserConfig>;

  export const UserForm = {
    descriptors: DESCRIPTORS as unknown as AnyFieldDescriptors,
  };
  ```

  This is good:

  ```ts
  export const UserForm = {
    descriptors: DESCRIPTORS,
  };
  ```

  This is bad (the cast is forced by a field that should carry a real type,
  so every use of it needs one):

  ```ts
  type Props = { tooltipProps?: unknown };
  <Chart tooltipProps={tooltipProps as unknown as TooltipProps} />;
  ```

  This is good:

  ```ts
  type Props = {
    tooltipProps?: ComponentProps<typeof Chart>["tooltipProps"];
  };
  <Chart tooltipProps={tooltipProps} />;
  ```

- Use `as const` for literals that never change.

- Prefer `type` over `interface`, except for class-style OOP interfaces.

  **Find candidates:**

  ```bash
  grep -rEn '^(export )?interface ' --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
  ```

  Class-style interfaces (used with `implements`) are the documented
  exception; verify before flagging.

- Prefer `undefined` over `null`. The **only** exception is when an
  external type signature forces `null` into your code *at the exact
  position in question*: a framework callback whose parameter is typed
  with `null` (for example Supabase's `onAuthStateChange((event, session:
  Session | null) => ...)`), or a value whose type you do not control (a
  database row column typed `x | null`, a third-party return type).

  Merely *receiving* a `T | null` value from an external call does **not**
  license `null` in your own declarations, parameters, or return types.
  Normalize it at the boundary with `?? undefined` and keep everything
  downstream `undefined`-based. "The value came from an API that returns
  `null`" is not sufficient justification on its own.

  **Per-hit decision** (apply to every candidate below): ask *is the
  `null` in a type signature I own, or am I only receiving it from
  something external?* If it is in a signature you own, such as a local
  variable, a parameter, a return type, or module state, it must be `undefined`
  unless an external signature at that same position forces `null`.
  Otherwise, normalize.

  **Find candidates:**

  ```bash
  grep -rEn '\bnull\b' --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . \
    | grep -Ev '(json|jsonb|\| *null|: *null *,|= *null *;|return null)' \
    || true
  grep -rEn '(: *null\b|\| *null\b|= *null\b|return null\b)' \
    --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
  ```

  This is bad (a wrapper we own propagates the external `null` instead of
  normalizing it, and module state defaults to `null`):

  ```ts
  // We own this return type, so the `| null` is our choice, not the SDK's.
  async function refreshSession(): Promise<Session | null> {
    const { data } = await client.auth.refreshSession();
    return data.session; // Session | null straight through
  }

  let onExpired: (() => void) | null = null; // our module state
  ```

  This is good (normalize at the boundary; every signature we own uses
  `undefined`):

  ```ts
  async function refreshSession(): Promise<Session | undefined> {
    const { data } = await client.auth.refreshSession();
    return data.session ?? undefined;
  }

  let onExpired: (() => void) | undefined = undefined;
  ```

  The `null` that is genuinely forced stays. If a library types a callback
  parameter as `Session | null`, a handler written against that signature
  keeps `null`, because the position is not one you own:

  ```ts
  client.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session: Session | null) => {
    // ...
  });
  ```

- Prefer string literal unions over enums.

  **Find candidates:**

  ```bash
  grep -rEn '^(export )?enum ' --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
  ```

- Reuse composite types when they are genuinely shared.

- Avoid extracting one-off type aliases unless the type is reused. `Props` is
  the explicit exception.

- If an object shape has 4 or more properties, extract it to a named type for
  readability.

- Add explicit types at module boundaries, top-level declarations, and function
  parameters. Avoid unnecessary annotations for local variables and inline
  callbacks.

- Follow input contravariance and output covariance: readonly at module
  boundaries for inputs, mutable outputs for callers.

- Apply readonly wrappers to function parameters, not to local variables,
  internal helpers, or return types.

  **Find candidates** (`Readonly<...>` applied to local vars or return
  types; heuristic):

  ```bash
  grep -rEn '\bReadonly<' --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
  ```

  Filter hits: only flag the ones applied to local variable
  declarations, internal helper return types, or shared type aliases,
  not to function parameters (which are correct).

- Prefer mutable local variables and intermediate values.

- If a function intentionally mutates its input, the name should make the
  mutation obvious, and returning `void` is usually the clearest contract.

- For string-literal unions that are referenced at runtime (for parsing,
  validation, dropdown options, or `zod` enums), derive the type from an
  `as const` runtime array so the values are written once. Expose the
  runtime array and an `isValid` type guard on the matching module so
  callers don't have to rebuild the `Set` inline.

  **Find candidates** (string-literal unions with 3+ members):

  ```bash
  grep -rEn '^\s*\| *"[^"]+"' --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
  ```

  Cross-check each hit: if the same literal list is also written as a
  runtime `Set`, array, or `z.enum(...)` somewhere else, the union
  should derive from an `as const` array instead.

  This is bad:

  ```ts
  export type QueryAggregationTypeT =
    | "sum"
    | "avg"
    | "count"
    | "max"
    | "min"
    | "group_by"
    | "none";

  // some other file
  const VALID = new Set([
    "sum", "avg", "count", "max", "min", "group_by", "none",
  ]);
  function isValidAgg(value: string): value is QueryAggregationTypeT {
    return VALID.has(value);
  }
  ```

  This is good:

  ```ts
  export const QUERY_AGGREGATION_TYPES = [
    "sum",
    "avg",
    "count",
    "max",
    "min",
    "group_by",
    "none",
  ] as const;

  export type QueryAggregationTypeT = (typeof QUERY_AGGREGATION_TYPES)[number];

  export const QueryAggregationTypeModule = {
    /** All valid aggregation values. */
    values: QUERY_AGGREGATION_TYPES,

    /** Type guard checking whether a string is a valid aggregation. */
    isValid: (value: string): value is QueryAggregationTypeT => {
      return (QUERY_AGGREGATION_TYPES as readonly string[]).includes(value);
    },
    // ...
  };
  ```
