# The web app (`apps/web`)

A React 19 single-page application built with Vite, styled with
[Mantine](https://mantine.dev), routed by
[TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router), and fetching through
[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query). There is no server-side
rendering and no server entry point: everything runs in the browser.

As of step 3b, `apps/web` is the application's skeleton rather than a
placeholder: the design system, the theme, the route map and the chrome are
real. No product surface is built. Every route renders a short placeholder
inside the real chrome, and nothing fetches: step 4b is the first step that
talks to a server.

## Providers

`src/main.tsx` imports its stylesheets before anything else, in an order
that matters:

1. `@mantine/core/styles.css` and `@mantine/dates/styles.css`, Mantine's own
   sheets.
2. `src/styles/fonts.css`, the `@font-face` blocks.
3. `src/styles/tokens/tokens.css`, the custom properties those fonts and every
   colour are written in terms of.
4. `src/styles/global.css`, which overrides Mantine's own focus ring and
   needs the tokens above it to already exist.

Each layer depends on the one before it, so a later import beats an earlier
one on specificity exactly where that is intended.

It then mounts three providers, outermost first:

1. `QueryClientProvider` with the shared client from `src/queryClient.ts`.
2. `MantineProvider` with the theme from `src/theme/theme.ts`, the
   `cssVariablesResolver` from its own file beside it (which bridges the design tokens onto Mantine's own
   CSS variables), and `defaultColorScheme="auto"` (which lets Mantine's own
   `color-scheme` agree with whichever panel is actually showing, without
   changing any colour: the resolver writes the same palette into both of
   Mantine's colour-scheme blocks).
3. `RouterProvider` with the router from `src/router.ts`.

## Styling

The visual language is documented once, in [`../DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md);
`src/styles/tokens/tokens.css` is that record expressed as CSS custom
properties.

**Four renditions, four inks each.** Day, Porcelain, Slate and Night each
declare exactly four inks (`--panel`, `--print`, `--ink`, `--accent`), and
every other colour in the system is a `color-mix` in oklab of those four.
That is why switching renditions is one `data-rendition` attribute on
`<html>` rather than a second stylesheet, and why a fifth hand-picked colour
is a bug rather than a design choice.

**The rendition follows the operating system, not a setting.** Nothing in
the product lets a member choose a rendition: `design-spec.md` gives no
surface a control for it, and the pile arrangement is the only thing
`DESIGN.md` names as instance-level. So `tokens.css` ships all four
renditions but only two are reachable: a `@media (prefers-color-scheme:
dark)` block maps a dark system preference to Night's four inks, light
(and no preference) stays Day. The media query only applies to
`:root:not([data-rendition])`, so an explicit `data-rendition` attribute on
`<html>` still wins over the system preference; nothing writes one today,
but the rule (and Porcelain and Slate) stay reachable for the day something
does.

**`data-pile`** carries the pile's arrangement (`tidy` or `messy`) the same
way: an attribute on `<html>`, read by `system.module.css` wherever the
arrangement changes the pile's layout. `index.html` currently hardcodes
`data-pile="messy"`; nothing computes it from a setting yet.

CSS Modules for anything custom, Mantine components and theme tokens for
everything else, no TailwindCSS. The full rules are in
[rules/styling.md](rules/styling.md).

## The design system

`src/system/` holds the thirteen shared components (the chrome, the pile, the
reactions control, the people field, and the rest of the world Mantine does
not give us) and one 180-class CSS module, `system.module.css`. One component
per file, and a family that has several (`Chrome/`, `Pile/`, `Talk/`,
`typography/`, `Chip/`) is a directory of them; anything with a test sits in
its own directory beside it. They were
lifted out of `prototypes/src/system/` in step 3b: most were retyped against
the frozen DTOs in `packages/shared` in the process (a handful, like `Pile`
and `ProductBar`, still declare a small local prop type for a shape that has
not been frozen yet), and every read of a prototype fixture module became a
prop instead.

`src/system/labelHelpers/` holds every string derived from a number or a date
(a count, a relative time, a date range), kept in one place so the same value
never gets formatted two different ways in two components.

**Nothing under `apps/` may import from `prototypes/`.**
`src/boundaries.test.ts` scans every file under `apps/` for an import
specifier that mentions `prototypes` and fails if it finds one, so the rule
in `AGENTS.md` is enforced rather than just stated.

## Routing

File-based. Add a file under `src/routes/` and the TanStack Router Vite plugin
regenerates `src/routeTree.gen.ts`. Never edit that file, or any other
`*.gen.*` file, by hand. `src/router.ts` registers the router type globally so
route params and search params are typed everywhere.

**Two shells.** `__root.tsx` holds no chrome of its own; every page renders
inside one of two layout routes beneath it:

- **`sign-in.tsx`**, the signed-out shell: a top bar and a centred card. It is
  a sibling of `_app`, not a child, because a guard that redirected to a
  guarded route would loop.
- **`_app.tsx`**, the signed-in shell: the guard runs in `beforeLoad`, then
  the product bar wraps an `<Outlet />`. The other thirteen routes are its
  children.

**The route map is flat.** Fourteen routes cover the product's web surfaces;
there is no `/admin` prefix, because role is an attribute of a destination
and not a path segment. Two surfaces share a route each: `/items/$itemId`
covers both a photo and a video, since a link cannot know which until the
item has been fetched, and `/` covers the timeline, the empty archive and
the filtered pile, since a filter is a search parameter on the same pile
rather than a different page.

**The guard has exactly one seam.** `src/session/requireViewer/` exports
`viewerQueryOptions` and `requireViewer`. `requireViewer` is the whole guard:
given no viewer, it throws a redirect to `/sign-in` carrying the attempted
href, so a shared link that requires sign-in leads there and then back.
Because there is no session yet (that is step 3a's, and `GET /api/me` does
not exist), `viewerQueryOptions`' query function currently resolves a
hardcoded placeholder viewer and never touches the network. Step 4b replaces
that one function body with a real `apiFetch` call against `/me` and changes
nothing else: everything that needs a viewer already reads it through
`viewerQueryOptions`.

Because routing is client-side, a hard refresh on a deep link reaches the
server, which serves `index.html` and lets the router resolve the path. See
[server.md](server.md#serving-the-web-app).

## Talking to the API

Two modules under `src/api/`:

- **`client.ts`** holds `apiFetch`, which prefixes `/api`, sends credentials,
  and **parses the response body with a Zod schema**. Responses are validated
  rather than trusted, so a client and server that have drifted apart fail
  loudly at the boundary instead of producing `undefined` five components
  deep. A non-2xx response becomes a thrown `ApiRequestError` carrying the
  server's `status`, `code`, `message`, and now `details`: the structured
  data the error envelope carries beyond its English message
  (`fieldErrors` on a 400, `retryAfterSeconds` on a 429,
  `attemptsRemaining` on a sign-in code). `message` is for a log or a
  fallback and is never the primary UI copy. A 204 response has no body, so
  `apiFetch` returns `undefined` for it rather than trying to parse one.
- **One module per resource**, exporting TanStack Query `queryOptions` rather
  than hooks. Options can be used by a component, a route loader, or a
  prefetch; a hook can only be used by a component. `health.ts` is the example
  to copy.

`src/queryClient.ts` retries a failed request once, except a 4xx: Memory
Shoebox talks to its own server on the same origin, so a same-origin failure
is usually real, and a 404, a 403 or a 429 is real by definition. Retrying
one only doubles the latency of a genuine refusal.

There is no configurable API base URL, by design. The API is always at `/api`
on the same origin: Fastify serves both in production, and the Vite dev server
proxies `/api` to port 8080 in development. See
[architecture.md](architecture.md#one-origin-one-deployment).

## Development server

`pnpm dev:web` starts Vite on **http://localhost:5173** with `strictPort`
behavior left at Vite's default. `/api` is proxied to `http://localhost:8080`,
so the API server has to be running too. `pnpm dev` from the repository root
starts both.

## Tests

Vitest, running in `jsdom` with Testing Library
(`@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`,
`@testing-library/user-event`), because the design system's thirteen
components are tested by rendering them.

`vitest.setup.ts` shims three things jsdom does not provide, all needed for
Mantine's dropdowns and menus to render in a test at all:

- **`window.matchMedia`**, which Mantine's internals call (`Modal`, for
  instance) even though nothing in this design system uses a responsive hook
  directly. The shim answers `false` to everything, which is enough for
  Mantine to fall back to its narrowest value.
- **`Element.prototype.getBoundingClientRect`**, along with the document's
  `clientWidth`/`clientHeight`. jsdom does no layout, so every element's
  bounding box and the viewport's own size come back 0x0 by default; Floating
  UI (what Mantine's `Popover` and every dropdown in this design system sit
  on) reads both to decide whether its target has been clipped out of view,
  and a 0x0 target inside a 0x0 viewport reads as fully clipped forever, so
  the dropdown renders `display: none` and never opens. The shim gives both
  sides a plausible size instead.
- **`window.ResizeObserver`**, which Mantine's `ScrollArea` (what a `Select`,
  `MultiSelect` or `TagsInput` dropdown scrolls its options inside) calls to
  size itself. jsdom has no implementation at all, so the shim is a no-op
  stub that never fires a callback; nothing here asserts on a resize, only
  that the dropdown mounts.
