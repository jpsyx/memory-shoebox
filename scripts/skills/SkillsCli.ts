/**
 * `pnpm skills` - the front door to this project's agent skills.
 *
 * Two tools install skills here and neither knows about the other: `npx
 * skills` handles everything in `skills-lock.json`, and a skill that ships its
 * own installer, such as `impeccable`, installs itself. This CLI wraps both so
 * there is one place to ask what is installed and one place to change it.
 *
 * The skills themselves are not tracked in git. `install` and `update` are
 * separate on purpose, and they mirror how pnpm treats packages: `postinstall`
 * runs `install`, which only adds what the lock asks for and is missing, while
 * `update` is the explicit step that fetches newer versions.
 *
 * Only the install is implemented in TypeScript. Updating lives in
 * `scripts/skills/update-skills.sh` and this CLI simply runs it, because a
 * generated project may have no TypeScript tooling at all: one shell script is
 * what lets every project, whatever it is written in, update its skills the
 * same way.
